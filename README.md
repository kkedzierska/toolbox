scripts and pipelines used for me in everyday work

* **canonical** - converts gtf file to bed file with exons for canonical transcript
* **fistom**- takes bed file (or annotated by homer peak file) and performs motif search (MEME-chip) on the input. Includes some parsing of the output files.
* **compMotifs** - compares results from two motif searches, produces unique and common results.
